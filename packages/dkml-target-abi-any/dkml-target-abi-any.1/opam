opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "The presence of this package means at least one dkml-target-abi-* package is present."
description: """
When a package should be selected based on the target ABI rather than the host ABI,
the opam's "arch" architecture variable should not be used when _any_ dkml-target-abi-* package is present.
For example, an Apple Silicon host machine supports both ARM64 and Intel architectures, but
the "arch" variable will always be arm64 even when a cross-compiling "ocamlopt -config" says the
"architecture" is x86_64. The presence of dkml-target-abi-darwin_x86_64
should force the selection of the Intel architecture variant, just as the presence of
dkml-target-abi-darwin_x86_64 tells dkml-base-compiler to create OCaml binaries for Intel.

Multiple dkml-target-abi-* packages may be present when multiple ABIs should be available for cross-compilation.
The dkml-target-abi-any package will be present if one or more dkml-target-abi-* packages are present.

The typical use case is when you have several binary packages that you have precompiled, and
your ocamlopt is a cross-compiler that reports a "architecture" that is in conflict with "arch".
Using dkml-target-abi-any will simplify your opam package filters.

Usage:

Instead of the incorrect selector:
  depends: [
    "somebinary-macos-x86_64" { arch = "x86_64" & os = "macos" }
    "somebinary-macos-arm64" { arch = "arm64" & os = "macos" }
  ]
use:
  depopts: [
    "dkml-target-abi-any"
    "dkml-target-abi-android_arm32v7a"
    "dkml-target-abi-android_arm64v8a"
    "dkml-target-abi-android_x86"
    "dkml-target-abi-android_x86_64"
    "dkml-target-abi-darwin_arm64"
    "dkml-target-abi-darwin_x86_64"
    "dkml-target-abi-linux_x86"
    "dkml-target-abi-linux_x86_64"
    "dkml-target-abi-windows_arm64"
    "dkml-target-abi-windows_x86"
    "dkml-target-abi-windows_x86_64"
  ]
  depends: [
    "somebinary-macos-x86_64" {
      dkml-target-abi-darwin_x86_64:installed |
      (!dkml-target-abi-any:installed & (arch = "x86_64" & os = "macos"))
    }
    "somebinary-macos-arm64" {
      dkml-target-abi-darwin_arm64:installed |
      (!dkml-target-abi-any:installed & (arch = "arm64" & os = "macos"))
    }
